# 🛡️ Network Security System – Phishing Website Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Network Security System** is a machine learning–based web application designed to **detect whether a website is legitimate or a phishing site** based on extracted URL and network-related features.

The system automates the **end-to-end ML pipeline**, including:
- Data ingestion from MongoDB
- Data validation and drift detection
- Data transformation
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction through a FastAPI web interface

It is built with **production-grade architecture**, following modular design, logging, exception handling, and CI/CD readiness.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Phishing websites pose a serious cybersecurity threat by mimicking legitimate websites to steal sensitive information.  
This project aims to **classify website data as either legitimate or phishing**, helping organizations and users improve network security.

## 🧠 Solution Approach

1. **Dataset**
   - Phishing website dataset stored in MongoDB
   - Features extracted from URLs and website metadata

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - Data Ingestion
   - Data Validation (Schema & Drift Detection)
   - Data Transformation (Preprocessing & Imputation)
   - Model Training (Classification models)
   - Model Evaluation
   - Prediction & Output generation

3. **Web API**
   - FastAPI-based REST service
   - Upload URL and receive phishing predictions

## 🗄 MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account:  
   https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

2. Create a new cluster (Free Tier M0 works)

3. Create a database and collection:
   - Database name: `your_db_name`
   - Collection name: `your_collection_name`

4. Add your IP address to **Network Access**

5. Create a database user and note:
   - Username
   - Password

6. Set your Database name and Collection name as a constant for data ingestion:
   -  Go to networksecurity/constant/training_pipeline/__init__.py
   -  Replace DATA_INGESTION_COLLECTION_NAME value with your MongoDB Collection name
   -  Replace DATA_INGESTION_DATABASE_NAME value with your MongoDB Database name

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```env
MONGO_DB_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<db_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
